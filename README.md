# COMP 250: Introduction to Computer Science
##### Offered by: McGill School Of Computer Science 

## Overview
Object oriented programming in Java (classes and objects, interfaces, inheritance). Mathematical tools (binary numbers, induction, recurrence relations, asymptotic complexity, establishing correctness of programs). Data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, binary trees, binary search trees, heaps,hash tables). Recursive and non-recursive algorithms (searching and sorting, tree and graph traversal, BFS and DFS). Abstract data types.
